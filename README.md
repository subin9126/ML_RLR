# ML_RLR
<b> Machine Learning - Regularized Logistic Regression </b>

Implementation of RLR using glmnet package.
* Use Train_and_Predict_glmnet.m to construct an <b> elasticnet model </b> from a training dataset and evaluate its performance on an independent test dataset.
* Use NestedCV_glmnet.m to perform nested cross validation on a single dataset.
